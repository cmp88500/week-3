<h3>A Stress Test</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include several questions.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>One that lists warning signs of being negatively affected by stress (loss of sleep, overwhelmed, etc)</li>
    <li>One that lists health symptoms</li>
    <li>Another that lists recommended coping methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Then, based on user answers, provide some guidance: For instance, if a user reports 4 stress-related symptoms, and 6 warning signs apply to them, suggest some resources to help them out.</li>
  <li>Or, if a user says 4 warning signs of high stress apply to them, but they also report using 5 of the recommended ways to manage stress, tell them they're doing a pretty good job.</li>
  <li>Include at least 3 possible results.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it looks like we will have three groups of checkboxes: one for warning signs, one for health symptoms, and one for coping methods. Scores will be tallied for each group, and certain scores would lead to certain outcomes.</p>
<p>My partner and I decided to make three divs for each group with unique IDs for jQuery purposes (#group1, #group2, #group3), and identical classes for CSS styling (.group). All three groups would be wrapped within a form tag with ID (#formOne), given a paragraph to label each group, and 12 checkboxes each, all with same name(input-name1, input-name2, input-name3), and all the checkboxes will have unique values. After the last div is closed out, a button will close it out before we wrap up the form. We will also need a place to display our outcomes, so a paragraph (#response) is added after the form. Here is how it should look (only one group of checkboxes shown):</p>
<div class="pic" id="stressHTML">
<p>And here is how it should look on the page:</p>
  <form id="formOne">
    <div id="group1" class="group">
      <p>Here is what you get.</p>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="A">Option A</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="B">Option B</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="C">Option C</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="D">Option D</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="E">Option E</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="F">Option F</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="G">Option G</input><br>
      <input name="input1" type="checkbox" value="H">Option H</input><br>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" id="btn" class="btn btn-danger">Submit</button>
  </form>

<p>The form ID is important.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, you should run a branching statement. In the exercise, they want you to have alerts for three different outcomes:
  <ul>
    <li>One for having at least 6 warning symptoms and 4 stress related symptoms, with less than five stress relief activities practiced.</li>
    <li>One for having the symptoms above, but with practicing five or more activities</li>
    <li>One for fewer symptoms in general</li>
  </ul>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<div id="checkboxJS"></div>
<ol>
  <li>Usual jQuery beginning</li>
  <li>Define 3 variables, all 0s</li>
  <li>jQ for first div of checkboxes</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Link each input in group</li>
      <li>Define variable for the # of checks</li>
      <li>Link to output spot on HTML</li>
      <li>For each check, add 1 to initial variable</li>
      <li>Console log to confirm it works</li>
      <li>Repeat for other inputs divs</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Branch statements</li>
    <ul>
      <ol>
</div>
</body>
